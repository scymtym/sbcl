;;;; This file provides a functional interface to global information
;;;; about named things in the system. Information is considered to be
;;;; global if it must persist between invocations of the compiler. The
;;;; use of a functional interface eliminates the need for the compiler
;;;; to worry about the actual representation. This is important, since
;;;; the information may well have several representations.
;;;;
;;;; The database contains arbitrary Lisp values, addressed by a
;;;; <Name,Info-Number> pair, where Info-Number is identified by
;;;; a <Category,Kind> pair, each being a keyword. The Name is a thing
;;;; which we are recording information about. [Names are compared by EQUAL.]
;;;; Category and Kind create a taxonomy of the data values for a thing.
;;;; For example, '+ names both a function and a variable, so has (at least)
;;;; two categories of information. Within each category, we have several
;;;; pieces of info, and in fact some of these have the same-named :Kind
;;;; such as <:FUNCTION,:TYPE> and <:VARIABLE,:TYPE>.
;;;; (And sometimes the Kind is literally :KIND, as a consequence of
;;;; how users of the database desire to name their keys.)

;;;; The relation between this file and 'info-vectors' is that the
;;;; latter provides a fundamental mechanism to create property-list-like
;;;; things whose "indicators" are restricted to small integers.
;;;; The globaldb abstraction is layered on top of that and is responsible
;;;; for translating <Category,Kind> to a small integer.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.

;;; Should a default value be itself a function, this must be expressed as
