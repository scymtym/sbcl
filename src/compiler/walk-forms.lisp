;;;; Special-operator-, macro- and application-aware code walker

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; TODO This file only contains original code. Still derived from CMU note?

;;;; The code in this file is organized into multiple layers
;;;; implemented on top of each other:
;;;;
;;;; 1. The fundamental layer is WALK-FORMS which only knows about
;;;;    special forms (via SPECIAL-OPERATOR-INFO) and relies on
;;;;    functions it receives as arguments for function/macro lookup
;;;;    and macro expansion.
;;;;
;;;;    WALK-FORMS is also not tied to a specific result
;;;;    representation: the result is constructed from the values
;;;;    return by the callback function. TODO better name than callback
;;;;
;;;; 2. WALK-FORMS/RECONSTITUTE TODO

  "Apply FUNCTION to FORM and its sub-forms, return a RESULT-TYPE sequence.

The lambda-list of FUNCTION has to be compatible with

  (instead recurse current-form kind name &rest components)

where (in the following, FUNCTION*, FORM*, NAME* and COMPONENTS* refer
to the above parameters where ambiguity would otherwise arise)

  INSTEAD
    A function with lambda-list (&key function form) that FUNCTION*
    can call to walk FORM with FUNCTION independently of the current
    FUNCTION* and FORM*.

    Default values of the FUNCTION and FORM keyword parameters are
    FUNCTION* and FUNCTION*'s CURRENT-FORM argument respectively.

  RECURSE
    A function with lambda-list (&key function components) that
    FUNCTION* can call to walk COMPONENTS of FORM* with FUNCTION. If
    supplied, COMPONENTS has to be a plist of the form

      (COMPONENT-NAME1 SUB-FORM1 COMPONENT-NAME2 SUB-FORM2 ...)

    where COMPONENT-NAMEN are the keywords naming components according
    to KIND and NAME. Note that only evaluated components can be
    specified for recursive walking.

    Default values of the FUNCTION and COMPONENTS keyword parameters
    are FUNCTION* and the evaluated COMPONENTS* FUNCTION* received
    respectively.

  KIND
    An object of one of the following types (see CLHS 3.1.2.1 \"Form
    Evaluation\" for the specification of forms in Common Lisp):

    SB-C:LEAF-INFO subtypes:

      SB-C:VARIABLE-INFO
        FORM is a reference to a variable. NAME is identical to
        FORM. Depending on the function supplied as CLASSIFY-VARIABLE,
        the following COMPONENTS may be available:

          :TYPE     TYPE-SPECIFIER
          :CONSTANT BOOLEAN
          :WHERE    :GLOBAL | :LEXICAL | NIL
          :ACCESS   :READ | :WRITE | :BIND

      :SELF-EVALUATING | :LEAF (SBCL extension)
        FORM is a self-evaluating object or (compiler-internal) LEAF
        structure. NAME is identical to FORM.

    SB-C:SPECIAL-OPE
      FORM is a special form whose CAR is the special operator
      NAME. COMPONENTS (see below) contains the different syntactic
      components of the special form and depends on NAME.

      For example, the THROW special operator is described as

        KIND       = :SPECIAL-FORM
        NAME       = 'THROW
        COMPONENTS = :TAG TAG-FORM :RESULT-FORM RESULT-FORM

    SB-C:APPLICATION-INFO subtypes:

      SB-C:LAMBDA-APPLICATION-INFO | SB-C:NAMED-APPLICATION-INFO
        FORM is one of the two applications

          (FUNCTION-NAME             ARGUMENTS)
          ((LAMBDA LAMBDA-LIST BODY) ARGUMENTS)

        NAME is FUNCTION-NAME in the former case and the symbol
        CL:LAMBDA in the latter case. Depending on the function
        supplied as CLASSIFY-APPLICATION, the following COMPONENTS may
        be available:

          :ARGUMENTS   ARGUMENT-FORMS            both cases
          :WHERE       :GLOBAL | :LEXICAL | NIL  only named case
          :LAMBDA-LIST LAMBDA-LIST               only lambda case
          :BODY        BODY                      only lambda case

    SB-C:MACROID-INFO subtypes:

      SB-C:MACRO-INFO | SB-C:COMPILER-MACRO-INFO | SB-C:SYMBOL-MACRO-INFO
        FORM is a macro application of the form

          (NAME ARGUMENTS)

        NAME is NAME*, the name of macro, function or
        symbol-macro. Depending on the functions supplied as
        CLASSIFY-VARIABLE and CLASSIFY-APPLICATION, the following
        COMPONENTS may be available:

          :ARGUMENTS ARGUMENTS
          :WHERE     :GLOBAL | :LEXICAL
          :EXPANDER  FUNCTION

        For all kinds of macros, calling RECURSE expands the macro (by
        calling the function supplied via EXPAND-MACRO with the value
        of the :EXPANDER component) and walks the expansion.

      SB-C:SETQ-WITH-SYMBOL-MACROS-INFO
        TODO

  NAME
    Depends on KIND. See description of KIND for possible meanings.

  COMPONENTS
    A plist of component names and component forms depending on KIND
    and NAME. Individual components can be received by using &KEY
    parameters in FUNCTION's lambda-list. See description of KIND for
    possible values.

FUNCTION's return value is incorporated as an element in nested
sequences of type RESULT-TYPE that are generally shaped like FORM and
the tree of its sub-forms. However, transformations performed by
FUNCTION can of course lead to different shapes.

CLASSIFY-VARIABLE has to be a function with lambda-list (form) that,
when called with symbol, returns up to four values:
1) a kind which has to be either :VARIABLE or :SYMBOL-MACRO
2) a scope which has to be either :GLOBAL or :LEXICAL
3) a type specifier describing the type of the variable
4) a plist TODO
When FORM does not name a variable or symbol macro, kind has to be
NIL (or no values can be returned).

CLASSIFY-APPLICATION has to be a function with lambda-list (form)
that, when called with a function or macro application form (but not a
special form), returns up to three values:
1) a kind which has to be either :APPLICATION, :COMPILER-MACRO
   or :MACRO
2) a scope which has to be either :GLOBAL or :LEXICAL
3) a plist TODO
When the CAR of FORM does not name a function or macro, kind has to be
NIL (or no values can be returned).
