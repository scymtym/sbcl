;;; The inverse for a generalized-variable reference function is stored in
;;; one of two ways:
;;;
;;; A SETF inverse property corresponds to the short form of DEFSETF. It is
;;; the name of a function takes the same args as the reference form, plus a
;;; new-value arg at the end.
;;;
;;; A SETF method expander is created by the long form of DEFSETF or
;;; by DEFINE-SETF-EXPANDER. It is a function that is called on the reference
;;; form and that produces five values: a list of temporary variables, a list
;;; of value forms, a list of the single store-value form, a storing function,
;;; and an accessing function.

;;; Historical note: The hack was considered evil becase prior to the

;;; were SETF expanders. To "invert" (APPLY #'F A B .. LAST), you assumed that

;;; gensyms between the "getter" and "setter" forms), you'd stick APPLY
;;; in front and hope for the best. Plus AREF still had to be special-cased.
